- I need a "Hat" option when adding a product. In "Size For" dropdown when adding product, please add Hat as an option with the following sizes "OSFA , S/M , M/L , L/XL , XL/XXL"
- I need a "Hard Good" option when adding a product. This will be for any item we decorate that's not something you wear (pens, notepads, bags, etc). The only size we need is OSFA

ALTER TABLE `orders` 
ADD COLUMN `is_printed` int NULL DEFAULT 0 AFTER `comp_due`;
