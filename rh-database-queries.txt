- When emailing a comp, the COMP LINK button disappears when email template is picked. (Done)
- When customer approves/not approves comp, can there be a window that pops up stating "Thank you! We will process your submission shortly" (Done)
- After customer approves/not approves comp, the email sent to the sales rep shows "Response for Comp ORDER NAME Quote". Can you please remove the word Quote so it's not confused with the actual quote that will be approved as well? (Done)
- After customer approves/not approves comp, the notification that shows up in program shows "Quote Approved: Order Name". Can you please change that to "Comp Approved: Order Name" to not get it confused when the actual quote is approved? (Done)
- In "View Activity" for each order, can you show both the "Quote Preview" and "Comp Preview" for what was sent to the customer? I really like this feature, but we just need to show both the comp and quote that was sent. (Done)

- In order tab, can you please add new column named "Comp" and place it between Status and Quote Approval column. 
- Please have a dropdown option for "Comp" column with the following choices:
In Art Room (Yellow)
Changes Needed (Red)
Approved (Green)
Approved No Films (Teal)
Films Done (Black)
Comp Sent (Blue)
Need Approval (Purple)
Reorder (Pink)

- With this new column, can the dropdown option in orders page reflect what is picked in the comps page dropdown box? Meaning, if I'm in the Comps page in an order and I select the option "Approved", then the dropdown box in the Comps column on the orders page will also show "Approved" (Done)

- In Quote and Comp email template, can you add {quote_link} and {comp_link} so the link to approve either the quote and comp will automatically generate when sending the approval email (Done)

- one major issue I ran into was the layout of the YELLOW when we go to print. Please see attached
